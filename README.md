# Hotel-Registration-Form
Exciting News! ðŸš€  I'm thrilled to share my latest Task-4 project from the Digital Bhem Internship. I've created a comprehensive tutorial on Designing a Basic Hotel Booking Registration Form using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project has been a fantastic opportunity to apply and expand my web development skills.
